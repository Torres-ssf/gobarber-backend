<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Sever-side application for GoBarber, an application for service providers, such as barbers, to control customer schedules. The application is deployed on Heroku and can be tested through the [Interactive API documentation](https://gobarber-api-torres.herokuapp.com/documentation/).

## API Documentation

Click [here](https://gobarber-api-torres.herokuapp.com/documentation/) to explore the interactive API documentation. The documentation was created with [swagger UI](https://swagger.io/). You can test all API requests. Many requests require user authentication and, as this application uses the JWT to grant authorization to users, you will need to create a session before using authenticated requests. To do so, you can simply:

1. Click on the post `users` request to expand it.

2. Click on the `Try it out` button.

3. Insert your credentials to create a new user and then click on the `Execute` button.

4. You should receive an 200 response and that means that your user was successfully created.

5. Now click in the post `sessions` request to exapand it.

6. Click on the `Try it out` button and then provide the user/email combination from the user you just created

7. You should receive a successful response with the authorization token.

8. Now copy the token value and click on the `Authorize` button that lives almost at the top of the page. Paste the value and click on `Authorize` again.

9. Now you are authenticated and can test all requests from the API.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This application is dockerized, if have `docker` and `docker-compose` on you system it's pretty straightforward to start using it. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node
- NPM
- Yarn
- Docker
- PostgreSQL (not needed if you have docker)
- Redis (not needed if you have docker)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Torres-ssf/gobarber-backend
```

2. CD into the project root directory

```sh
cd gobarber-backend/
```

3. Install npm packages

```sh
yarn
```

4. Run the app

  This project uses a docker file to run the app, a Postgres contaner and a Redis container in a shared network. By running `docker-compose up` no additional configuration is required. I recommend using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for simplicity. However, if you want to run without Docker, you will need both Postgres and Redis running at your system. Additional steps are also required.
  - Make a copy of both `.env.example` and `ormconfig.example.json` files.
  - Rename `.env.example` copy to `.env`.
  - Rename `ormconfig.example.json` copy to `ormconfig.json`
  - Edit `ormconfig.json` file with your own postgres credentials, remember to also assign an existent database.
  - Redis host and port can be set up at the `.env` file. No password is required.
  - Run the migrations with the command: `yarn typeorm migration:run`.

### Usage

If you have `docker` and `docker-compose` at your system:

```
docker-compose up
```

To remove docker containers after using the app, run:

```
docker-compose down
```

##### App Scripts:

```
yarn dev:server
```
Script for development stage. An output message should appear on the terminal: `Server started on port 3333!`

```
yarn typeorm
```
Used for operations related to Typeorm, like creating migrations.

```
yarn build
```
Transpile Typescript code into Javascript inside the dist directory.

### Run tests

```
yarn test
```
